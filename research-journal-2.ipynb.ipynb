    "Since the last research journal, our focus was on applying **progressive selection criteria (cuts)** to identify **Milky Way (MW)–Andromeda (M31) analog pairs** in the COCO simulation. This involved:  \n",
    "- Defining **mass, distance, and velocity constraints** to match MW-M31.  \n",
    "- Removing **third massive galaxies** to ensure isolation.  \n",
    "- Making our **code modular** for easier experimentation with different cuts.  \n",
    "\n",
    "After filtering, we identified **7 candidate galaxy pairs** that closely resemble MW and M31 in terms of **mass, separation, and relative radial velocity**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Motivation:\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this research is to study the **dynamical evolution** of MW-M31-like galaxy pairs. By filtering the dataset to match real-world constraints, we ensure that:  \n",
    "1. The selected galaxy pairs **closely resemble MW and M31** in terms of physical properties.  \n",
    "2. We can later apply the **two-body problem and timing argument** to these pairs to reconstruct their **orbital history**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding MW-M31 analogs helps us:  \n",
    "- Study **galaxy mergers and interactions** in a cosmological setting.  \n",
    "- Compare simulation results to real observational data.  \n",
    "- Ensure that **MW-M31's past motion is dynamically consistent** with predictions.  \n"

    "## Describe what happened during your activities for the week.\n",
    "\n",
    "We applied a series of **filtering steps** to extract **MW-M31 analog pairs** from the COCO simulation.  \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Mass Cut**  \n",
    "   - The paper suggests a **brightness cut**, but our dataset does **not** contain brightness data.  \n",
    "   - Instead, we converted this into a **mass cut**:  \n",
    "     - **Mass range:** **\\(0.5 \\times 10^{12} M_{\\odot} - 5 \\times 10^{12} M_{\\odot}\\)**  \n",
    "     - After this cut, we had **170 galaxies**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Distance Cut**  \n",
    "   - Since MW and M31 are **780 kpc apart**, we needed similar distances in our dataset.  \n",
    "   - We applied a **distance filter of 500 kpc – 1 Mpc**, leaving **several galaxy pairs**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Isolated Pair Selection**  \n",
    "   - MW-M31 is an **isolated** system (no other massive galaxies nearby).  \n",
    "   - We **removed pairs that had a third large galaxy in close range**, leaving **7 pairs**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Relative Radial Velocity Cut**  \n",
    "   - MW and M31 are **moving toward each other**.  \n",
    "   - We kept **only pairs with negative relative radial velocity**.  \n",
    "   - **All 7 pairs already satisfied this condition**, so no additional galaxies were removed.  \n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Code Modularization**  \n",
    "   - We **refactored** our filtering script into **functions** to allow reordering and reapplying cuts easily.  \n",
    "   - This ensures that we can experiment with different selection criteria efficiently.  \n",
