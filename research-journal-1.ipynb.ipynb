    "Over the past month, we focused on setting up access to the **COSMA** system ([COSMA Docs](https://cosma.readthedocs.io/en/latest/account.html)) to retrieve and analyze data from the **COCO simulation** ([COCO Paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.11490)). This involved multiple steps, including account creation, SSH key setup, and waiting for system approval. Additionally, we had to navigate a system maintenance period, which delayed our progress.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Once we gained access, we explored key data attributes such as:\n",
    "- **DM_mass** (dark matter mass)  \n",
    "- **subhalo_pos** (subhalo positions)  \n",
    "- **subhalo_vel** (subhalo velocities)  \n",
    "- **subhalo_number** (number of subhalos)  \n",
    "- **subhalo_Rmax** (maximum radius of subhalos)  \n",
    "- **subhalo_Vmax** (maximum velocity of subhalos)  \n",
    "- **m_200** and **r_200** (virial mass and radius)  \n",
    "- **subhalo_dm_masses** (dark matter masses of subhalos)  \n",

    "We began by **setting up a virtual environment** and installing the necessary libraries and dependencies required to work with the COSMA system and COCO simulation. This included:\n",
